Game Art Style/Ideas:
British Gas Concept 	- http://massiveblack.com/mbwp/?p=1007
Planetary Annihilation 	- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqDSh34VoPY
Voxel Planet 			- http://www.bassvisuals.com/voxel-planet-earth-globe-spin-loop-versions/

Gameplay Ideas:
# Skill system like RuneScape with little interaction.
# MMO
# Ingress like real world perks? Go to a hotspot and get some loot/bonus?
# Micro transactions, offer game free.
	# Top 8 Grossing games are "free" - so micros.
		# Use BitCoin? Gets it more known, offer discount to encourage users, no fees.
# World Generation, probably Voxel based.
