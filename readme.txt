Game Art Style/Ideas:
British Gas Concept - http://goo.gl/bjuUp
Planetary Annihilation - http://goo.gl/JWsQI
Voxel Planet - http://goo.gl/w1DBh

Gameplay Ideas:
# Skill system like RuneScape with little interaction.
# MMO
# Ingress like real world perks? Go to a hotspot and get some loot/bonus?
# Micro transactions, offer game free.
	# Top 8 Grossing games are "free" - so micros.
		# Use BitCoin? Gets it more known, offer discount to encourage users, no fees.
# World Generation, probably Voxel based.
